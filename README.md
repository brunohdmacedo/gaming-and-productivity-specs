# Gaming & Productivity Specs
Have you ever wondered why a 
Mac machine cannot be used
as a dedicated gaming machine? And
why is Windows OS the preferred gaming machine?
Even though you can say that these
computers are all-purpose, some
machines have advantages and
disadvantages as productivity
or gaming machines.

Don't get me wrong, light games
or browser-based games can be played
well on a Mac. I tested the 4k iMac playing
the online Counter Strike, pure
browser-based, and it was doing well
better than the 1080p gaming PC build.

## Mac Vs Windows 
## Display | Resolution | Display Scaling
As we all know, a Mac machine is the choice as
a productivity machine. It has the UI
simplicity and the best display on
the screen, true tone and retina.
It scales well when you project
a Mac machine on a very large screen
even if it is UHD.

Windows on the other hand is good
in 1080p but the scaling is not
that good compared to Mac.
Even just for 1080p external monitors,
the way things were scaled would
not be proportional. 

## The Graphics
Macs graphics are good
but not that much for gaming while
Windows, on the other hand, 
almost all graphics specs
are provided by vendors because
it is the preferred machine for gaming.
It only means several others support
Windows more than Mac, as you know, Mac
has a limited outside support when
it comes to hardware. They even released
their very own M1 chip.  

We all know graphics and resolution are two
different things. Graphics card is dedicated for
the graphics to be accelerated so
that, say, a 4k 3D drawing can be displayed
almost without delay. Whereas resolution
is just the pixels per inch on the screen.
Without a dedicated graphics card or none at all,
it will be the processor that will process
the graphics so that it can be displayed
on the screen. This will also be different
when it is 4k or 1080p, as 4k pixels 
are more compact than 1080p and that
puts pressure on the processor.

## The Terminals
This is also where the two machines vary
sharply.

Mac's advantage is that it is based on
UNIX, the original machine for software
developers whereas Windows originated
from MS-DOS, which was not a UNIX-based OS.

So, Mac is most of the time the preferred
machine for developers given
the terminal commands are really
important for them. Plus, those
who really want to install Linux
on a Mac machine will be a great
choice compared to a Windows machine.

For gaming, the native terminals are negligible.

## About Retina Display
There are so many confusing articles
about the Retina display. So let's take
a look at this.

Depending on the distance given,
every pixel per inch can be retina.
Even a 1080p can be retina if
you view it far enough! 

Here is a very good calculator for that:

Well, Apple just made it happen
so that we have a better viewing experience.
Even good smartphones back then
were naturally retina for a good
viewing experience, especially that
we view them close to our eyes.

The only downside of having a very high
resolution for a certain size is that
it will make things smaller, that for
those who don't have a normal vision
will find it very hard to see.

So for a normal computer viewing
distance, 1080p is a good starting point
for a 27" computer monitor although
it's not retina at a normal viewing
distance but our eyes can relax.
A 4k 32 inches monitor will make things
bigger compared to a 4k 21 inches monitor,
so our eyes can actually relax too.

In gaming, a 24" 1080p is the optimal one,
so that you have a good view at normal
viewing distance at the same time maximizing
the refresh rate so that there is almost
no delay when you press a certain command,
particularly for First Person Shooter games
like Counter Strike. 1080p will not demand
much processor compared to a 4k of the same size.
