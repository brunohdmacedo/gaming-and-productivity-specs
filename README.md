# Gaming And Productivity Specs
Have you ever wondered why a 
Mac machine cannot be used
as a dedicated gaming machine? And
why is Windows OS the gaming machine?
Even though you can say that computers
we are using are generic, they have their
own focuses.

Don't get me wrong, light games
or browser-based games can be played
well. I tested the 4k iMac playing
the online Counter Strike, pure
browser-based, and it was doing well
better than the 1080 gaming PC build.
What we are referring here are those
demanding games like COD.

## Mac Vs Windows 
## The Display, the Resolution and Display Scaling
As we all know, Mac machines are the choice as
productivity machines. It has the UI
simplicity and the best display on
the screen, true tone and retina.
It scales well when you project
a Mac machine on a very large screen
even if it is UHD.

Windows on the other hand is good
in 1080p but the scaling is not
that good compared to Mac.

## The Graphics
This is where they have significant
differences. Macs graphics are good
but not that much for gaming while
in Windows, almost all graphics specs
are provided by vendors because
it is the preferred machine for gaming.

We all know graphics and resolution are two
different things. Graphics card is dedicated for
the graphics to be accelerated so
that, say, a 4k 3D drawing can be displayed
almost without delay. Whereas resolution
is just the pixels per inch on the screen.
Without a dedicated graphics card or none at all,
it will be the processor that will process
the graphics so that it can be displayed
on the screen. This will also be a different
one when it is 4k or 1080p, as 4k pixels 
are more compact than 1080p.

## Native Console Commands
This is also where the two machines vary
sharply.

Mac's advantage is that it is based on
UNIX, the original machine for software
developers whereas Windows originated
from MS-DOS, which was not a UNIX-based OS.

So, Mac is most of the time the preferred
machine for developers. Plus, those
who really want to install Linux
on a Mac machine will be a great
choice compared to a Windows machine.
